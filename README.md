## Description
I wanted to create a website that goes through the GitHub REST API and returns the user data similar to a dating app like Tinder. I want to see candidates one at a time and have the option to either dismiss or save a candidate. Once saved, candidates would appear again on a table where I could further narrow down the selection by removing a candidate row from the table.
